              <h4>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</h4>
              <span> What are obsessions?</span>
              <p>Obsessions are persistent thoughts, pictures, urges or doubts that appear in your mind again and again. They interrupt your thoughts against your control, and can be really frightening, graphic and disturbing. They may make you feel anxious, disgusted or uncomfortable.</p>
              <span>What's it like to live with OCD?</span>
              <p>Although many people experience minor obsessions (such as worrying about leaving the gas on, or if the door is locked) and compulsions (such as avoiding the cracks in the pavement), these don't significantly interfere with daily life, or are short-lived.</p>
               
              <span>If you experience OCD, it's likely that your obsessions and compulsions will have a big impact on how you live your life:</span><br>
               <p> - Disruption to your day-to-day life. Repeating compulsions can take up a lot of time, and you might avoid certain situations that trigger your OCD. This can mean that you're not able to go to work, see family and friends, eat out or even go outside. Obsessive thoughts can make it hard to concentrate and leave you feeling exhausted.<br>
                - Impact on your relationships. You may feel that you have to hide your OCD from people close to you â€“ or your doubts and anxieties about a relationship may make it too difficult to continue.<br>
                -  Feeling ashamed or lonely. You may feel ashamed of your obsessive thoughts, or worry that they can't be treated. You might want to hide this part of you from other people, and find it hard to be around people or to go outside. This can make you feel isolated and lonely.<br>
                - Feeling anxious. You may find that your obsessions and compulsions are making you feel anxious and stressed. For example, some people feel that they become slaves to their compulsions and have to carry them out so frequently that they have little control over them. You can read more about anxiety here.</p><br>

                <p>
                  <spma>Types and examples of obsessions:<br> </spma>
                 1. Fear of causing or failing to prevent harm<br>
                  - Worrying you've already harmed someone by not being careful enough. For example, that you have knocked someone over in your car.<br>
                  - Worrying you're going to harm someone because you will lose control. For example, that you will push someone in front of a train or stab them. <br>

                  2. Intrusive thoughts, images and impulses<br>
                 - Violent intrusive thoughts or images of yourself doing something violent or abusive. These thoughts might make you worry that you are a dangerous person.<br>

                 3.Religious or blasphemous thoughts that are against your religious beliefs<br>
                  - Relationship intrusive thoughts often appear as doubts about whether a relationship is right or whether you or your partner's feelings are strong enough. They might lead you to end your relationship to get rid of the doubt and anxiety.<br>
                  - Sexual intrusive thoughts or images. These could be related to children, family members or to sexually aggressive behaviour. You might worry that you could be a paedophile or a rapist, or that you are sexually attracted to someone in your family.<br>
                 
                 4.  Fear of contamination<br>
                  - Contamination (for example by dirt, germs or faeces). You might worry that you have been contaminated and that you - or other people - are spreading the contamination. You might worry that you have or might get a disease.<br>
                  - Mental contamination. You might experience feelings of dirtiness that are triggered by a person who has harmed you in some way. These feelings may also be triggered by your own thoughts, images or memories<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                  <span>- What are compulsions?</span><br>      
                  Compulsions are repetitive activities that you feel you have to do. The aim of a compulsion is to try and deal with the distress caused by obsessive thoughts.<br>
                 You might have to continue doing the compulsion until the anxiety goes away and things feel right again. You might know that it doesn't make sense to carry out a compulsion - but it can still feel too scary not to.<br>
                 Repeating compulsions is often very time-consuming and the relief they give you doesn't usually last very long.<br>
                - Compulsions can:<br>
                 1. be physical actions<br>
                 2. be mental rituals (people who only have mental compulsions sometimes refer to their OCD as Pure O)<br>
                 3. involve a number (for example, you might feel you have to complete a compulsion a specific number of times without interruption).<br>

                - Types and examples of compulsions: 
                1. Rituals
                -  washing your hands, body or things around you a lot<br>
                - touching things in a particular order or at a certain time<br>
                - arranging objects in a particular way<br>

               2. Checking<br>
               - checking doors and windows to make sure they are locked<br>
- checking your body or clothes for contamination<br>
- checking your body to see how it responds to intrusive thoughts<br>
- checking your memory to make sure an intrusive thought didn't actually  happen<br>
- checking your route to work to make sure you didn't cause an accident<br>

3. Correcting thoughts<br>
- repeating a word, name or phrase in your head or out loud<br>
- counting to a certain number<br>
- replacing an intrusive thought with a different image<br>

4. Reassurance<br>
- repeatedly asking other people to tell you that everything is alright<br>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>What is 'Pure O'?</span><br>

- Pure O stands for 'purely obsessional'. People sometimes use this phrase to describe a type of OCD where they experience distressing intrusive thoughts but there are no external signs of compulsions (for example checking or washing). The name is slightly misleading as it suggests that there are no compulsions at all.<br>

 - If you have Pure O you will still experience mental compulsions but you might not be aware of them. Because they are not as obvious as physical compulsions, it can sometimes be difficult to define exactly what these compulsions are.<br>

 - Here are some examples of internal compulsions:<br>

1. Checking how you feel - for example, you might check to see if you are still in love with your partner.<br>
2. Checking bodily sensations - for example, you might check to see if you were aroused by an intrusive thought.<br>
3. Checking how you feel about a thought - for example, you might check whether you are still upset by the thought.<br>
4. Repeating phrases or numbers in your head.<br>
5. Checking if you still have a thought - for example, first thing in the morning.<br>
